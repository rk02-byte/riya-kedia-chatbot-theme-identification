Attacks on Virtual 
Storage
Data Leakage
Data Remanence
Dumpster Diving
Hash Value Manipulation
Attacks on Virtual Storage
• Data Leakage: 
• Attacks such as password guessing and dumpster 
diving can lead to VM data leakage
• Attacker can also use key logger and gain 
authentication into target VM and breach its data.
Attacks on Virtual Storage
• Data Remanence: 
• Data Remanence represents residual information 
of the data remained after deletion. 
• Various file handling operations such as the 
reformatting of storage, deletion operation may 
result in data remanence. 
• Such operations can cause disclosure of sensitive 
information
Attacks on Virtual Storage
• Dumpster Diving 
• Dumpster diving is an attempt of deriving 
information from data which is declared as waste.
• The data is recovered by the attacker that is 
discarded by cloud users or admin to gain useful 
information out of it.
Attacks on Virtual 
Storage
• Hash Value Manipulation:
• An attacker may manipulate the hash value of the message 
and can get authorized access to the file stored in the server. 
• If manipulated hash value exists in the database, server links 
the file to that hash value. 
• If the modified hash value does not exist, server requests a file 
from the user.
Attacks on Hardware (Low-Level)
Direct Memory Access (DMA) Attack
System Management Mode (SMM)
Basic input/output System (BIOS)
If physical access to the host machine is obtained, it may facilitate hardware 
threats on the machine
Attacks on Hardware 
(Low-Level)
• Direct Memory Access (DMA) Attack: 
• DMA code can be subjected to malware 
infections to launch stealthy attacks 
against host-kernel by executing on 
dedicated hardware. 
• An attacker can access cryptographic keys 
for the hard disk and user's sensitive 
information located in a cache
Attacks on Hardware 
(Low-Level)
• System Management Mode (SMM) 
• SMM is the highly privileged mode of CPU which 
deals with system security and power 
management functions
• On insertion of the SMM pin, the CPU saves its 
entire state in separate address location called as 
SMRAM. 
• SMM is vulnerable to cache poisoning attack 
which allows an attacker to insert malicious code 
temporarily in SMRAM. 
Attacks on Hardware 
(Low-Level)
• Basic input/output System (BIOS) 
• BIOS is responsible for implementation of 
SMM
• Any vulnerability in BIOS can be used to 
tamper the SMM functioning and allows 
an attacker to take illegitimate access to 
system security functions
